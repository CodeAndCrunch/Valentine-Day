          <h2>A Special Beginning ❤️✨</h2>

       <p>Some people come into our lives unexpectedly, yet leave a lasting impact. You are one of those rare souls who make every moment feel a little more special.

        From the very first conversation, something about you stood out—your kindness, your charm, and the effortless way you make the world around you brighter.
        
        This isn’t just a collection of words; it’s a small way of showing how much you mean to me. A way to remind you that you are appreciated, admired, and truly special.
        
        So, here’s to us—our conversations, our connection, and the beautiful moments yet to come. 💖</p>

          <p>
            It’s incredible to think how, just a year ago, I didn’t even know you. Meeting you during that experiment in the chemistry lab was a moment of fate that I’ll always be grateful for.

            At first, I wasn’t sure how we’d connect, what we’d talk about, or what kind of person you’d be. But now, after spending time with you, I’ve realized something truly special—
            
            You’re absolutely amazing. 💖
            
            Your words, your kindness, and the way you make me smile have already made a place in my heart. I never expected to meet someone like you, but now, I can’t imagine not having you in my life.
            
            Maybe it was destiny, or maybe it was just luck—but whatever it was, I’m glad it brought me to you. 💕

            Talking to you all day and night, seeing you on video calls, calling you Chotuu, sweetheart, shortcake... and finding ways to irritate you just to see that beautiful smile—it’s how my days go, and honestly, this is everything I’ve ever wanted. 💖

Every message from you, every call, every laugh, it’s like a little moment of happiness that makes everything better. Your presence, even through a screen, fills my day with joy and warmth. 🥰

          <h1>A Wish from the Heart 💫💖</h1>
          <p>
            Every day around 4 PM, my heart starts racing a little—because I know I’ll see you. That one moment of my day where everything else fades, and it’s just you. And every time, I wish that when you see me, you’d run straight into my arms, hold me tight, and kiss me like you own those lips—like they belong to you and no one else. 💋❤️

I want you to show me your rights, to claim me without hesitation. That when I walk toward you, you turn to your friends with that beautiful smile and say, "That’s my man." 💞

Every second with you is something I look forward to, and every 4 PM feels like the best part of my day—because it’s the time I get to see you. And when the moment finally comes where I can hold you close, I just want it to be something we never forget. ✨🔥

        </div>
        <div class="back">
          <h1>Always Here for You 💖✨</h1>
          <p>
            You are everything to me, and I want you to know that no matter what, I’ll always be here for you. If you ever need anything—someone to listen, someone to annoy you just to make you smile, or someone to remind you how incredible you are—I’m just a message away.

My time, my presence, my heart—they’re all yours whenever you need them. ❤️

Life can be unpredictable, but one thing that will never change is that you’re not alone. Whether it’s a good day or a tough one, whether we’re talking all day and night or just stealing little moments at 4 PM, I’ll always be here—supporting you, standing by you, and making sure you never forget how special you are.

You deserve nothing but happiness, and if I can be even the smallest reason for your smile, I’d consider myself lucky. No matter where life takes us, just know that you’ll always have me—someone who’s yours in every way. 💖🔥
